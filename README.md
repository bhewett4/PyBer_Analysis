# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analyis

This project was designed to run an analysis on different categories of ride sharing usage based on environment in order to discover trends as they relate to neighborhood demographics. The visualization will help us determine accessibility to ride sharing services based on location as well as how fares may change in relation to where the ride occurs.

## Results of the Analysis

* As we see below, the data presents information that one could easily infer based on general knowledge of ride sharing: the closer you are to the city center you are, the easier it is to get a ride and the less expensive that ride will be. We see that in the urban area, there are 2,405 drivers eligible to pick up a fare, however as we go into the suburban area that number drops to 625 and then reduces even further in the rural area to 78 total drivers. In addition to the reduced number of total drivers, we see that the fare increases exponentially as we move away from the city. In the urban area the average fare per ride is $24.53 which increases by approximately $10 to $34.62 in the rural areas.

* The below graph gives us an excellent visualization in the disparity of total fares between the different types of locations

## Summary

After reviewing this data, three primary ideas come to mind in order to address the disparities between the three city types:

* Offer a discount for rides that are coming from a rural or suburban area into the city center or urban area
* Increase the profit margin for drivers for picking up rides in rural areas so they are incentivized to leave the city center, hence creating more driver availability for rural areas
* Offer pooled rides with larger vehicles for groups of people commuting between either the rural areas or suburban into the urban area. While this would leave the driver count in the rural and suburban areas the same, more passengers would be able to be accommodated in a single ride
